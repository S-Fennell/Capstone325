            Most people don't onsider the difference between weight loss and fat
            loss and how certain diets effect their results. The wrong approach
            can lead to more muscle loss than fat loss, resulting in a skinny
            fat look which is not desirable. Skinny fat is when you may appear
            slim but your skin has a sagging appearance. This is because of the
            subcutaneous fat, which is the fat under the skin. The other type of
            fat is visceral fat, which is fat in gut around the organs and the
            most dangerous type of fat and often unnoticable. A skinny person
            can have a lot of visceral fat and may look like what is called a
            beer belly, but this is about subcutaneous fat.

            When trying to lose weight we must think in terms of body fat. This
            is becausewe don't want to lose weight in lean muscle mass. our
            muscle mass is what defines our shape. If you're losing muscle
            you're losing your shape. This is highly undesireable for woman who
            want to enhance the look of theri figure. The best way to do this is
            to make sure most of your calories come from protein, the macro
            nutrient responsible for building muscle. Protein also has a
            thermodynamic effect, meaning the body burns more calories to degest
            protein. A gram of protein equal 4 calories as well as a gram of
            carbs. However, 1 gram of faat equals 9 calories making fats calorie
            dense and this is why it should be eating in moderation when it
            comes to cutting calories.

            3,500 calories equals one pound of fat. so to burn a pound of at a
            person must burn 3,500 calories. To do this a person must be in a
            calorie deficit. To be a calorie deficit you must consume less
            calories than yor daily maintenance calories. Your daily maintenance
            calories are the calories your body burns for bodyly function such
            as pumping the heart, processing food, thinking, yes, thinking. The
            brain actually is responsible for most of the energy the body
            consumes. it also worth noting that calories are energy. Calories
            are the energy your body burns. They are on in the same. This is a
            good time to bring up the dea of metabolism. Your metabolism is the
            energy your body uses to pump the heart, operate your liver,
            kidneys, grow yor hair and nails, etc. Everything your body does
            requires energy. This is you metabolism at work. It's also
            worthnoting that this is the energy you burn doing nothing, laying
            in bed or on the couch. The calories you burn while doing things
            such as walking or doing chores are call NEAT- None Exercise
            Activity Theromgenesis. It refers to the energy expended on physical
            activities that aren't structured exercise, like walking, gardening,
            or even fidgeting.
